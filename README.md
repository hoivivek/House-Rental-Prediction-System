# Overview

The main intention of this project was to develop a user-friendly android 
application capable of predicting the rental prices of properties across Indian metropolitan 
cities. Real estate is a $326.5 trillion market globally. Traditionally, approaches to 
calculate the rent prices have been very imprecise. Individual valuers would review 
different data sources and vaguely estimate contributing factors and market conditions to 
arrive at a valuation. Leveraging the growing abundance of data and by using Machine 
Learning algorithms, we can predict house rents faster and more accurately than 
traditional methods. This helps buyers, tenants, sellers, banks, and insurers to make more 
informed decisions. 

The dataset consisting of features such as price, count of rooms and bathrooms, 
location, etc., was utilized for this project. The next step was to pre-process the data and 
then to apply various Machine Learning algorithms, which were evaluated by metrics 
such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Normalized Root Mean Squared Log 
Error(NRMSE) and Adjusted R-squared. Finally, the application was developed where 
the user could enter the data and get the predicted rent value of the house.
